# Crochet youtube channels analysis

Within this project, I would like to explore the following:

- Getting to know Youtube API and how to obtain video data.
- Analyzing video data and verify different common "myths" about what makes a video do well on Youtube, for example:
    Does the number of likes and comments matter for a video to get more views?
    Does the video duration matter for views and interaction (likes/ comments)?
    Does title length matter for views?
    How many tags do good performing videos have? What are the common tags among these videos?
    Across all the creators I take into consideration, how often do they upload new videos? On which days in the week?
- Explore the trending topics using NLP techniques
- Which popular topics are being covered in the videos (e.g. using wordcloud for video titles)?

Steps of the project:
1) Obtain video meta data via Youtube API for the top 10-15 channels in the data science niche (this includes several small steps: create a developer key, request data and transform the responses into a usable data format)
2) Prepocess data and engineer additional features for analysis
3) Exploratory data analysis
4) Conclusions
